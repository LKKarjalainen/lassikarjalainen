# lassikarjalainen â€” Astro starter

This repository contains a minimal Astro starter for a personal website.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Notes

- This is intentionally minimal. Replace the content in `src/pages/index.astro` and add new pages/components as you like.
- The project uses Astro; ensure Node.js (16.14+ recommended) is installed.
